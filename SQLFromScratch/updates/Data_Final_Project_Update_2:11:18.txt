Data Structures Final Project Update 2/11/18:
:::

1. Learnt basics of SQL

2. Cloned SQL parser repository, installed Maven, and set up dependencies

3. Went through SQL Parser test class with debugger to understand what the parser was returning (an object with different descriptions of what would need to be accomplished by the project)

4. Began mapping out what a database would look like. Recognized that a 2D array would be an inefficient tool for project because a database requires different object types to be used and 2D array only holds one type. So instead have begun drawing out on paper and constructing a very basic foundation of HashMaps and ArrayLists as the skeleton for the database.

5. Begun constructing a Column object and Table object that hold the characteristics the SQL parser returns in object form

6. In the middle of determining what methods will be necessary for Column and Table object as a basis, or ground level work, for building up the project and larger methods.	

::::
Over The Next Week:
:::

1. Go through Parser a bit more to double check and make sure I got the full understanding of the returned objects

2. Continue constructing Column and Table Class

3. Finalize basic skeleton of database

4. Begin mapping and perhaps begin coding Create Table portion of project

5. If complete that, evaluate plan going forward
